One day i was tired of buying fresh herbs, but unluckily i live in a apartment, where there is not direct sunlight most of the year.
Also i am a lazy guy and i wanted some kind of supervisor of the plant health and status, to track the plants, and automatize as much as possible, while its easy to setup
So i decided to create a tabletop planter which could give enough light to my plants, and also upload some stats and and images to a homeassistant server.

## Main features of first version:



- Smart home integrated (Homeassistant), easy OTA config with ESPHome, Automation throught nodeRED.

- Custom PCB with only thru hole components (easy solder).

- Based on ESP32cam so plenty of projects documentation available.

- Fully 3d printed frame.

- High efficiency and dimmable LED Driver and strips.

- Different light spectrum available.

- Adjustable Height.

- OLED realtime status show.

- Easily hackable (I2C Pins exposed).

## Electrical connections and PCB solder

Grass has its own small PCB board that puts together all the electronic components. Here you can check out the schematics and layout

To solder the PCB can be a little bit tricky, so i made the following video as a guide:

## Homeassistant ESPHome configuration

To control the light you need to add the ESPHome extension on the RPi and install a firmware on the esp32.

The following sketch contains the directives for ESPHome:

## NodeRed Automation

I used a nodered core server on the raspberry pi to control the the esp32cam, with esphome is pretty forward, in my case i am using the Sun component to turn on lights at sunrise and turn them down at dawn, but any time of automation is posssible.
