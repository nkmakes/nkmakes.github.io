description: Guide to build your own esp8266 wifi controlled turntable, based upon thingiverse user Bribro12 Fully 3D-printable turntable design.
---
I wanted a turntable to show off some prints, and after looking all-around the web i falled into amazings Bribro12's [Fully 3d-printable turntable](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3723618) and [Arduino controlled photogrammetry 3D-scanner](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3958326) designs. 

I liked a lot the gear/bearing system but i wanted to change a bit the aesthetics and electronic components, so i decided to modify the "enclosure" or "base" to fit my needs.

## Actual capabilities

Supports a series of accelerated and constant moves. 
Also can be set to spin indefinitevely in one or other direction at certain speed.
You set your desired moves in two ways:
- Using the incorporated web UI
- Using custom http API

---
## Required components

- 1x nodemcu esp8266
- 1x 12V to 5v Buck converter
- 1x 28-byj
- 1x uln2003
- 1x 12V power source
- 1x Female Jack adapter with screw terminals
- 6x Female to female Dupont cables
- 4x M3 screws and nuts

## 3dprinted components

### From [original design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3958326)
- 1 Outer Gear
- 1 Inner Gear

### From my [mod files](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4142700)

## Build Guide

### Schematics

![turntable esp8266 electronics]({{site.baseurl}}/images/turntable_circuit.JPG)

<br>

### Initial Electronics connections

To prepare for the build, first you need to:
    - Solder cables to 12v buck converter input.
    - Cut two dupont cables, and solder both ends of the resulting cables to each of the of the buck converter outputs.

### Component placement

1. Screw to the base: 
    - nodeMcu module
    - the stepper motor
    - The female jack power adapter

2. Once everything in place, connect the stepper driver, as described in the schematics:
    - to the motor
    - to the nodemcu
    - finally put the motor driver in place

3. If everything fits in place, it's the moment to place the buck converter, for this:
    - Connect the power outputs to the motor driver and esp8266
    - Screw the power input cables into de female Jack power input terminals


### Firmware setup

The full code of the program is available under the following [Github Repo](https://github.com/nkmakes/esp8266-3dprinted-turntable-UI)

You will need to:
1. Download the code
2. Open it in PlatformIO as a project
3. Configure the settings if needed in the src/config.h file
    - You can set up the Wi-Fi credentials, the number of turns needed for a full turn, and the stepper motor pin config
4. Upload the code
5. Upload the File System Image
    - You can find it in platformIO under "Project Tasks"

## How to use

### Web UI

In this moment the interface is divided mainly in two parts:
- List of movements
    - You can find three buttons under the text, from left to right:
        - Add: Adds a new movement to the list
        - Clear: Clears the movement list
        - Start: Starts the series of movements
    - For each moment you need to set:
        - Position: Set degrees desired to move, negative moves counterclockwise
        - Speed: Speed to make the move at
        - Acceleration: Acceleration and decelaration of the movement, set to 0 to make a constant speed move
- Set indef movement at speed
    - You can find the controls in the next white tab.
    - In this mode, you only need to set the speed, and click on ones of the arrows in the button zone.
    - You also have a stop button where you can stop the move, you can change the speed on the go, withouth needing to stop. This stop button works also if you had set a list of moves in the other mode.

You can test and edit the web UI under the following [CodePen](https://codepen.io/niko93rodriguez/pen/yLOvmoN), but be advised that as the project is in development, sometimes it's not fully updated.

### API

Currently supports the following http GET requests:
- Infinite movement: /infinite?speed=X
    - Params: 
        - Speed: if positive, moves clockwise, if negative, moves counterclockwise
- Stop: /stop
    - Stops any movement and free queue of movements
- Multiple moves: /multi?
    - Types of moves:
        - Constant: cons=pos;speed
        - Accelerated: accel=pos;speed;accel
    - Params:
        - pos: Distance to move, in degrees, negative means counterclockwise moves.
        - speed: Max speed in the move
        - accel: Acceleration of the move
