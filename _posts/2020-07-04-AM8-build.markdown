This is the build post about the first 3d printer completely assembled by me. I based this build on the cheapest 3d printer available at the internet at the moment, CTC prusa i3b from ebay which i got at home for 79â‚¬, it was a really bad quality wood Anet AM8 copy.

I first built the original printer but it had several flaws that caused a really poor print quality:

- The extruder got jammed all the time and while printing got a lot of oozing.
- The bed was made from wood so every print the nozzle offset changed.
- The bearings where really poor quality so the print wasn't very precise.
- The frame was really fragile and not sturdy at all, tried with some .
- The controller board was a defective AM8 board with a wrong bootloader so updates ghot really painfull.

So i bought a new frame for it and a new set of components, also i added a Rpi octorpint server with a webcam.

## Electrical Wiring

The electrical connections are pretty simple, all of the four stripes must go in parallel to have equal current.

For this you will need the 5 way wago connectors, where you connect both ends of DC voltage side of the driver and a cable from every strip.

AC drivers cables should be connected using connector of your coice to the AC cable with its corresponding plug.
